## ** Introduction**

### **Main Theme & Problem**  
ASLytics addresses the inaccessibility of online video content for Deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals, particularly on platforms like YouTube where sign language support is scarce. Traditional subtitles often fall short, with studies showing 84% of Deaf children struggle to keep up with caption speed (National Deaf Children's Society, 2021). As ASL is the primary language for many in the Deaf community (Mitchell & Karchmer, 2004), digital content often fails to meet their needs, creating a significant gap in access to information and entertainment.

### **What We Aim to Do**  
ASLytics is a full-stack AI-powered YouTube extension that transforms English captions into real-time ASL animations, providing the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community with equitable access to learning, information, and entertainment.

## **🗂️ Dataset**

We created a custom vocabulary dataset in pose format (joint position coordinates) by scraping over 4,400 word-level signs from ASL Signbank and Signing Savvy. Using pose estimation tools from the open-source Sign Language Processing project, we converted the videos into coordinate-based representations for real-time animation playback.
